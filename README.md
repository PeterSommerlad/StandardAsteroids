# StandardAsteroids
Asteroids, written using the proposed 2D API for C++

To build this you will need the reference implementation of the 2D API available here:
https://github.com/mikebmcl/N3888_RefImpl

You might also like to watch the ACCU Conference presentation available here:

This presentation was made using an earlier version of the API, but the description of the structure of the game code remains relevant.
Instructions for wiring the game into the API entrypoint are also contained therein.

I'm accepting blue-pencil pull requests on points of style.

If anyone would like to add Linux keyboard input collection that would be helpful.

I'll continue developing the game in parallel with the API; I'm hoping to present further developments at CppCon and Meeting C++.

Thanks for your interest!
